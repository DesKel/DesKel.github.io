Backdoor was created by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Roorkee. Even though the site is less well-known compared to HTB, THM, and CTFlearn, the challenges actually quite something. Something, you might never encounter before. The best thing is, the site is free for all.

All flags in Backdoor should be encoded to SHA-256 before submitting, the easiest way is to use an [online tool](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html).
