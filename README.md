## About me

I'm an Electronic enthusiast who interested in all sorts of electronic projects, especially on the embedded system and wireless technology. Besides that, I'm also taking cybersecurity as a secondary interest.

## A small note on embeddedhacker.com

Hello there, the purpose of this page serves as an archive and update for the embeddedhacker.com. The reason is the upkeep for the previous site was pretty high (~ USD 200/year). Since the GitHub page offers a free hosting service for bloggers for personal write-up, I decided to migrate all the contents from the [embeddedhacker] (www.embeddedhacker.com). 

** Migration progress: 0% **
