## Welcome to DesKel's official github page

Hello there, the purpose of this page serves as an archive for the  embeddedhacker.com. The reason is the upkeep for the previous site was pretty high (~ USD 200/year). Since the GitHub page offers a free hosting service for bloggers for personal write-up, I decided to migrate all the contents from the [embeddedhacker] (www.embeddedhacker.com) but it gonna take a while. 

** Migration progress: 0% **
