## A small note on embeddedhacker.com

The purpose of this page serves as an archive and update for the embeddedhacker.com. The reason is the upkeep for the previous site was pretty high (~ USD 200/year). Since the GitHub page offers a free hosting service for bloggers, I decided to migrate all the contents from the [embeddedhacker](https://www.embeddedhacker.com).

**Migration progress: 65.44%**
