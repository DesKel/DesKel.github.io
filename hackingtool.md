This is my review and/or introductory page for the hacking tools that available on the Internet such as GitHub, Git Lab, google drive, Sourceforge, and even tools from the deep web. This is a good place to hang around, especially the script kiddie. Even though I do not encourage people to be a script kiddie but with the tools that available straight from the shelf, it makes our life much simpler.
