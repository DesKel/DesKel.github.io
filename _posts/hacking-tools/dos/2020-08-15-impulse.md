The impulse is a great modern DoS tool for dosing web server, email, and even phone. The tool is written in python and supports both Linux and Windows. I just tested with my own phone and it works like a charm. Try to give a better thread number and you should deny the service in no time. For email DoS, you should create a dummy email address.

## Des's review

### The pro
1. Cross-platform
1. Work on-demand (24/7)
1. Support multiple DoS attacks

### The con
1. Consume lots of resources while performing high thread attack

**Des's score: 4.5/5 (On-demand DoS in a various way)**
