[old-61](https://webhacking.kr/challenge/web-38/) | 200 | SQLi

Hello there again, welcome to another webhacking.kr CTF challenge. Today topic is all about SQLi

![question](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-13-old-61/1.png)

Nothing interesting. How about the source code?

![source](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-13-old-61/2.png)

We are set as **Guest** by default. Also, there are some filters and only allowed 15 characters. Too many limitations. Of course, we can set the **id value as * (select all)** but it not going to work at all as the query only return 1 result with the alphabet as descending order (z to a).

This is more likely can be solved by using [SQL Alias](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_alias.asp). We can give the id a temporary name and it will be the **admin**. The initial payload should be

```
?id='admin' as id
```

Since the quotation mark is part of the filter or addslashes function to be precise, there is another way round.

```
?id=0x61646d696e as id
```

The value is exceeding 15 characters including space. I come across with [this Q&A](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53601879/using-alias-without-as) and [this Q&A](https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/95765/alias-using-as-and-without-using-as/95777),  we can perform the alias without the **'as'**. Which make our payload as

```
?id=0x61646d696e id
```

The value just contains 15 characters. Let's try it out.
