[old-18](https://webhacking.kr/challenge/web-32/) | 100 | SQL Injection

Welcome to another webhacking.kr web CTF style challenge. Today, we are going through a SQL injection (SQLi) room.

![question](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-18/1.png)

We got a query form at the front page, Let's inspect the source code.

![code](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-18/2.png)

Alright, we have a piece of SQL code inside the PHP section. Given the id of admin is 2, the payload of the URL based SQL injection should look like this

```
?no=2 or id='admin'
```

This is what the query look like

```
select id from chall18 where id='guest' and no=2 or id='admin'
```

The **id** parameter can be both guest and admin now due to the OR case. Also, the **no** parameter must be 2 as given by the hint of the challenge

However, judging from the code, it seems that space (x20) character has been filtered out by **preg_match** function and we have to bypass the filter. After a few searches, I come across the **tab key (x09)** bypass. The new URL based SQLi will look like this

```
?no=2%09or%09id='admin'
```
