Greeting again, welcome to webhackingkr CTF challenge. Today challenge involves the curl command from Linux.

Ha, look like we are not welcome. In addition, checking the source does not yield any good results. Guess we have to use the curl command to pull something from the webserver.

```
curl https://webhacking.kr/challenge/js-2/
```

Look like the page is instantly blocked by the alert function before showing any content. Sending a **?getFlag** request solves the challenge.

```
