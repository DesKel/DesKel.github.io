Welcome back to another good SQLi challenge by webhacking.kr.

![question](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-27/1.png)

Let's check the source code.

![code](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-27/2.png)

Look like we have some filters and SQL query on the script. Judging on the query, one might think the proper URL based SQLi payload should be like this

```
?no=2) or id='admin'--
```

Since the **space character (x20)** and **equal (=) sign** has been filtered out, we need to think another way. The possible way we are talking about is using the wildcard (LIKE) such that

```
?no=2) or no like 2--
```

Meanwhile the space character can be by passed using **Tab key (x09)**

```
?no=2)%09or%09no%09like%092--%09
```

Space after two dashes (**--**) is required for [some SQL database](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/comment-syntax/)
