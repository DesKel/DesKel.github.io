Howdy there, welcome to another webhacking.kr CTF challenge. Today's challenge is about JavaScript.

![question](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-13-old-58/1.png)

This is a JavaScript-based user console, not an actual Linux CLI. We can forget about the command-line injection.

By typing **help** command we have the following result.

- id
- flag
- ls
- help

There are only 4 options and our main goal is the flag command.

We need to escalate ourselves as an admin. How did we do that as we are assigned as a guest whenever the page is getting refreshed.

Actually, you just need thinker some of the parameters.

## Step 1: Thinker the JS code

```javascript
$(function () {
      var username = "admin";
      var socket = io();
      $('form').submit(function(e){
        e.preventDefault();
        socket.emit('cmd',username+":"+$('#k').val());
        $('#m_').val('');
        return false;
      });
      socket.on('cmd', function(msg){
        $('#messages').append($('<li>').text(msg));
      });
    });
```

- The username has been changed to admin
- Replacing the #m into **#k** (any alphabet show do, except m.). FYI, we are now changing the **input variable**

After that, submit the above code to the **console**

## Step 2: Thinker the HTML

Change the input naming from m to **k** (The alphabet refer to the JS code)

That's it, input the command and capture the flag.
