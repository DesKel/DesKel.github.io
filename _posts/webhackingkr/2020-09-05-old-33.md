## Challenge 1

![Q1](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/1.png)

Let's look at the source code

![Q1-source](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/2.png)

You are required to send a GET request to complete the challenge.

## Challenge 2

![Q2](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/3.png)

How about the source code?

![Q2-source](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/4.png)

It seems we have to send two post request to the server. It can be done either using a browser or burp suite. For this instance, I'm going to use the built-in request function inside the firefox.

![Q2-request](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/5.png)

Make sure you have change the method and the POST data before proceeding.

![Q2-method](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/6.png)

![Q2-data](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/7.png)

After you have done, double click the response and proceed to the next level.

## Challenge 3

![Q3](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/9.png)

![Q3-source](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/10.png)

Google [your own IP address](https://www.google.com/search?q=my+ip+address) and send the request

```
https://webhacking.kr/challenge/bonus-6/<reducted>.php?myip=<your IP address>
```

<span id="4"></span>

## Challenge 4

![Q4](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/11.png)

![Q4-source](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/12.png)

This challenge is a bit tricky where you have to refresh the page at the correct timestamp. My advice is to put the value with + 60 to 100 seconds delay. For example, the current timestamp is 1599313837, add 100 seconds makes 1599313937. After that, convert the delayed timestamp value using the following Linux command or [online tool](https://www.md5hashgenerator.com/)

```
echo -n 1599313937 | md5sum
```

Keep refreshing the page until you matched the timestamp on the hints.

## Challenge 5

![Q5](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/13.png)

![Q5-source](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/14.png)

Similar to [challenge 2](#2), this time you have to submit a dummy cookie, GET and POST request.

![Q5-request](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/15.png)

Double click the response and proceed to next level.

P/s: If the above method doesn't work, try adding the cookie value manually to the browser.

## Challenge 6

![Q6](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/16.png)

![Q6-source](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/17.png)

Similar to [challenge 2](#2) also but with cookie value **test=md5(Remote ip address)** and POST value **kk=md5(user-agent)**.

Submit the request and double click the response and proceed to the next level.

P/s: If the above method doesn't work, try adding the cookie value manually to the browser.

## Challenge 7

![Q7](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/19.png)

![Q7-source](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/20.png)

This challenge might be confusing if you are not familiar with PHP. This is a get request with the same naming and value. First of all, obtain your own [public IP address via google](https://www.google.com/search?q=my+ip+address). For example, my public address is 127.0.0.1 (just for demonstration purpose), removing the dot due to the replace function, we have 127001. The answer to the next level is

```
https://webhacking.kr/challenge/bonus-6/<reducted>.php?127001=127001
```

## Challenge 8

![Q8](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/21.png)

![Q8-source](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/22.png)

By default, the $addr is your public IP address. This challenge is simple, we can replace the $addr variable by sending a GET request.

```
https://webhacking.kr/challenge/bonus-6/<reducted>.php?addr=127.0.0.1
```

## Challenge 9

![Q9](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/23.png)

![Q9-source](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/24.png)

The answer is the [converting the decimal number 97,99,101,103...121 to ASCII character](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-hex-bin-dec-converter.html).

Submit the answer in get request format.

```
https://webhacking.kr/challenge/bonus-6/<reducted>.php?ans=<The ASCII>
```

## Challenge 10

![Q10](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/25.png)

![Q10-source](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-33/26.png)

Let me explain the PHP code line by line

```php
//server obtain your public ip
$ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];

//A small loop to replace the ASCII numeric to decimal.
for($i=0;$i<=strlen($ip);$i++) $ip=str_replace($i,ord($i),$ip);

//Replace dot to nothing
$ip=str_replace(".","",$ip);

//obtain the first 10 characters
$ip=substr($ip,0,10);

//Some mathematic
$answer = $ip*2;
$answer = $ip/2;

//No more decimal
$answer = str_replace(".","",$answer);

//Write the flag on the designated php file
$f=fopen("answerip/{$answer}_{$ip}.php","w");
fwrite($f,"<?php include \"../../../config.php\"; solve(33); unlink(__FILE__); ?>");
fclose($f);
```

At the end of the challenge, we have to know the final value for $answer and $ip. Once we have both values, visit the following URL to complete the challenge.

```
https://webhacking.kr/challenge/bonus-6/answerip/<$answer>_<$ip>.php
```

P/s: If you are lazy, use [an online compiler](https://www.w3schools.com/php/phptryit.asp?filename=tryphp_compiler).

Phew, what a challenge.
