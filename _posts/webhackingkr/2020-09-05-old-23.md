Welcome back for more webhacking.kr CTF challenge. Today challenge is cross-site scripting (XSS)

![question](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-23/1.png)

Your objective is to inject a simple XSS payload to the query (given by the challenge itself). However, the input has been sanitized or filtered where it only accepts a single alphabet but multiple special characters and numbers. To solve this challenge, I used the null-byte (x00) bypass. Since there is no way we can input the null byte on the input field, the best way is through the URL.

```
