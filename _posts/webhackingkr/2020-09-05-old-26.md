Howdy there, welcome back to another webhacking.kr CTF write-up. Today's challenge involves with some PHP script.

![question](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-26/1.png)

There is nothing we can do for the front page. Let's check the source code.

![code](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-26/2.png)

Key on the PHP script. To solve the challenge, we have to submit the GET request where **?id=admin**. However, the keyword, **admin** is filtered by the script.

There is another notable **urldecode()** function which serves as an important aspect to complete the challenge. The URL code for admin is

```
%61%64%6d%69%6e
```

The above-encoded URL is directly recognized by PHP as 'admin' where the filter still valid. Also, the **urldecode()** serves no use at all. How about performing another URL encode?

```
%2561%2564%256d%2569%256e
```

Alright, the PHP unable to interpreted the above-encoded text to 'admin' anymore, since %2561 makes no sense. Since PHP is a sequential programming,  with **urldecode()** function came after the filter, the above encoded text will be converted to **%61%64%6d%69%6e** or **admin** while bypassing the filter.

The final payload should be look like

```
?id=%2561%2564%256d%2569%256e%20
```
