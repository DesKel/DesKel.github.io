[old-24](https://webhacking.kr/challenge/bonus-4/) | 100 | PHP

Welcome back for another webhacking.kr CTF challenge. Today's challenge is about a simple PHP filter bypass.

![question](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-24/1.png)

The front page shows my remote IP address and user agent. Let's inspect the code.

![code](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-24/2.png)

Referring to the code, the remote address has to be 127.0.0.1 or a local address to solve the challenge. Let's put the local address issue aside first, how do we bypass the replacement filters? To bypass the filters, the $ip variable has to be

1<span style="color:#ff6666">12</span>27<span style="color:#ff6666">7.</span>..0<span style="color:#ff6666">0.</span>..0<span style="color:#ff6666">0.</span>..1

The red labeled text will be replaced to nothing while the two dots (..) will be replaced by a single dot (.). In the end, we get 127.0.0.1 after the replacement.

Alright, let's talk about the remote address. Since the input address is not a valid IP address, we can forget about the X-forward-for. However, if you noticed the source code again, you will notice the PHP script extract the **$_SERVER** as well as the **$_COOKIE**.

![cookie](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-05-old-24/3.png)

From there, we can replace **$REMOTE_ADDR from $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']** by assigning the same variable naming from the cookie.

The **$REMOTE_ADDR is actually from $_COOKIE['REMOTE_ADDR']**.
