Hello there, today we are going through a simple session hijacking challenge on webhacking.kr.

![question](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-08-30-old-1/1.png)

By looking at the given source code, the default 'user_lv' cookie is set as 1. To solve the challenge, we have to change the value in more than 5 (>5) and less than 6 (< 6).

Putting value 5.01 to 'user_lv' cookie and refresh the page solves the challenge.
