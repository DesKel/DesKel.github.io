Welcome back to another webhacking.kr challenge. Today's challenge is about SQLi with raw MD5.

![question](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-13-old-51/1.png)

Let's check the source code.

Look like both the id and pw input fields are both being sanitized. I can say, that is partially correct. Indeed, the addslahes function to filter out the quote into (\") and prevent us to perform the following attack

```
?id=admin"--
```

Guess the MD5 hashed password is the only way in. Remember, the script used a **raw MD5** which is damn vulnerable. Referring to the [MD5 PHP guide](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.md5.php), the script indeed setting the raw flag as **true**.

One might think including **'or'** as the raw MD5 character and actually that works but it consumes a lot of time. As proven by this [article](https://cvk.posthaven.com/sql-injection-with-raw-md5-hashes)

A 19 million cracked hash with speedup. Gosh. Alternatively, there is the other way by using simple python code. I'm talking about the **'='**. For your information **false = false** is equal to **true** and it makes the pw query like this

```
pw = '<false value>'='<false value>'
```

Then

```
pw = <Always true>
```

Then, I have drafted a python script

```python
import hashlib

for i in range (0,2000000):
	raw = bytes(str(i))
	result = hashlib.md5(raw)
	enc = str(result.digest())
	if(enc.find('\'=\'') > 0):
		print(i)
		break
```

The password is shorter than you think. Thrown in the **admin** as the id and the password to solve the challenge.
