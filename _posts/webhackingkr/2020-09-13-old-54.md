Welcome and welcome back to another webhacking.kr web-based CTF style writeup. As we going to walk through some interesting challenge on the site.

When you first visit the site, the last character of the header changes from time to time. Your target is to capture all the displayed characters. For this challenge, I'm going to use the Burp Suite.

There are a total of 38 responses need to be capture. If you missed a single or two characters, simply note down the value of ?m parameter and refresh the page. The 38 characters should form a valid flag.
