[old-14](https://webhacking.kr/challenge/js-1/) | 100 | JavaScript

Welcome back to another webhacking.kr CTF writeup. As for today challenge, we are going for to solve another JS.

![question](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-02-old-14/1.png)

Well, nothing interesting on the front page. How about the source code?

![code](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-02-old-14/2.png)

That's it, the JS code lead us to the solution. We have to find the value of **ul**. As you can see, the index starts at **.kr** from the URL of the challenge

```
https://webhacking.kr/challenge/js-1/
```

Which mean the indexed characters are **kr/challenge/js-1/**. It contains 18 characters. Hence the final **ul** value is **18*30 = 540**. Submit the value and complete the challenge.

Alternatively, try putting the code on [JS compiler](https://playcode.io/) and change the **ul** variable before running it.

```JavaScript
var ul="https://webhacking.kr/challenge/js-1/";
ul=ul.indexOf(".kr");
ul=ul*30;
console.log(ul);
```
