Hello there, welcome to another webhacking.kr CTF writeup. Today's is all about HTML and some base64 encoding.

![question](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-12-old-42/1.png)

The goal is simple, download the restricted **flag.docx** file. Let's check out the source code.

![source](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-12-old-42/2.png)

Referring to the code, there is a base64 encoded GET request value for **?down**. Decode the value and we get the following result

![decode](/assets/images/webhackingkr/2020-09-12-old-42/3.png)

It is a file name but in base64! The answer is clear now, encode **flag.docx** in base 64 format

Visit the following URL with the encoded text as ?down value.
