Another day, another CTF write-up from tryhackme challenge. Today, I am going to show you my third walkthrough on bsides Guatemala boot2root series. This challenge is a bit tricky where the challenger has to upload a file to the web server via the command line. Without further ado, let get into the challenge.

## Task 1: Capture the flags

As always, you CTF, you win. Guess I don't have to repeat it in the next boot2root write up ^^.

### Task 1-1: Capture user flag

Like we did in the usual way, fire up your Nmap with the following command.

```
nmap -A -v <MACHINE IP>
```

Guess we have only Port 80 (HTTP) opened in the server. No SSH or FTP port this time. Let's just focus on Port 80 then.

![apache](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-dav/3.png)

Nothing we can do with a default Apache2 page. For the next step, we are going to brute-force the directory using a wordlist. Fire up your gobuster with the following command.

```
gobuster dir -u <MACHINE IP> -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
```

After a few seconds, you will be prompted with a list of directories. Based on the list, the /webdav directory caught us some attention. Let's try to visit the hidden directory.

![auth](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-dav/5.png)

Shoot! We need a credential for the directory. Time to do some googling! After a few searches, I come [across this website](http://thisiszzzombie.blogspot.com/2011/12/webdav-xampp-1.html) where it stated that the default login credential is wampp:xampp. Let's give it a try.

![webdav](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-dav/6.png)

You now successfully break into the /webdav directory. What is inside the passwd.dav?

![password](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-dav/7.png)

Cracking the hash does not yield any interesting result. I guess this is the login credential for the /wedav directory. What can we do now? After googling and researching on webdev exploitation, [this site](https://github.com/blu0/webdav-exploit) enlightens me an idea on uploading a [PHP reverse-shell](https://github.com/blu0/webdav-exploit) into the server.

![reverse PHP](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-dav/8.png)

Make sure you change the IP address according to your [tunnel IP](https://tryhackme.com/access) and the port number. After that, upload the PHP shell to the webdav using the following command.

```
curl http://<Machine IP>/webdav/shell.php -u wampp:xampp --upload-file shell.php
```

![201](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-dav/9.png)

We got a 201 response from the server. The response means we have successfully uploaded the file into the server. Let's check with the webdav directory.

![upload success](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-dav/10.png)

Yes! Our shell is inside the directory. Before we click on the reverse-shell link, make sure you have your Netcat listener ready. After that, click the link.

```
nc -lvnp 4444
```

![netcat](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-dav/11.png)

You have now successfully generated a reverse-shell from the victim machine. Time to capture user's flag.

![user flag](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-dav/12.png)

### Task 1-2: Capture the root's flag

Let's see what we can do as a sudo user by using sudo -l command.

![sudo](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-dav/13.png)

We can use 'cat' command as the root user, cool. Let's check the root.txt using this sudo command.

![cat](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-dav/14.png)

Congratulation, you are now captured the root's flag. Easy and straight forward huh.

## Conclusion

That's all for my third boot2root by bsides Guatemala walkthrough. This walkthrough is a bit short compared to my last two write-up. Hope you enjoy this write-up and until next time ;)
