Another day, another walkthrough on a basic pentest challenge. This room covers all basic pentesting elements which are service enumeration,  Linux enumeration, brute-forcing, dictionary attack, hash cracking, and privilege escalate. Without further ado, let's get into the challenge.

## Task 1: Pentest the machine

You only have one task for the challenge, obtain all the information on the machine which includes password and username.

### Task 1-2: Enumerate the machine

Nmap scanning is a must for all pentester. This is one of the ways to obtain information on a machine. Punch in the following command to perform the scan.

```
nmap -Pn -A -v <MACHINE IP>
```

We have a total of 6 open ports available on the machine which is:

- SSH (Port 22)
- HTTP (Port 80)
- SMB (Port 139)
- SMB (Port 445)
- ajl13 (Port 8009)
- HTTP (Port 8080)
