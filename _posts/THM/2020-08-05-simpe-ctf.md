Hello there, welcome to another short and simple CTF challenge write-up from tryhackme. This challenge is a little bit different compared to my other write-up. It involved [CVE system](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve-help.php) or known as common vulnerabilities and exposures. CVE system provides a reference-method for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities and exposures. This made the challenge a little bit realistic. Without further ado, let's dig it up!
