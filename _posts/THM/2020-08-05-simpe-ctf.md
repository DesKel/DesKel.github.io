Hello there, welcome to another short and simple CTF challenge write-up from tryhackme. This challenge is a little bit different compared to my other write-up. It involved [CVE system](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve-help.php) or known as common vulnerabilities and exposures. CVE system provides a reference-method for publicly known information-security vulnerabilities and exposures. This made the challenge a little bit realistic. Without further ado, let's dig it up!

## Task 1: Capture the flag

You have only one task for this challenge, capture the flags.

### Task 1-1: How many open port?

This task required the user to find out the number of the open port under port number 1000. For this task, I am going to use nmap to find out the open ports.

```
nmap -p-1000 -A -v <Machine IP>
```

In case you need an explanation on the flag:
- -p-1000: Scan for first 1000 ports
- -A: OS detection, version detection and script scanning
- -v: Verbose mode

2 open ports are scanned which are port 21 (FTP) and 80 (HTTP).

### Task 1-2: What is in the higher port?

This is not the end for the nmap! Let's scan something beyond port 1000 using the following command.
