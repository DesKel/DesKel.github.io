## Basic 1

Basic 1 is the easiest challenge of the entire basic categories. The answer is located inside the HTML comment.

<span id="2"></span>

## Basic 2

This task is a bit tricky where you need a basic knowledge of HTML to solve this task. The maximum number allowed to enter into the solution field is 100, however, the task asks for 1000. Simply change the maximum number of the Input tag parameter and solve the challenge.

## Basic 3

Find the password? Where is it? By inspecting the source code, I come across a strange CSS file.

Open it up and read it. Eventually, you will find the flag.

<span id="4"></span>

## Basic 4

![basic 4 quest](/assets/images/challengeland/2020-08-12-basic/9.png)

You are required to enter 'Admin' in the solution field. However, the input field is disabled. Talking about disabling, we need to remove it from the input tag.

![basic 4 ans](/assets/images/challengeland/2020-08-12-basic/10.png)

Remove it and enter the text into the field.

<span id="5"></span>

## Basic 5

![basic 5 quest](/assets/images/challengeland/2020-08-12-basic/11.png)

This task is simple, just play around with the GET request on the URL bar. Just change 'guest' into 'admin'.

<span id="6"></span>

## basic 6

![basic 6 quest](/assets/images/challengeland/2020-08-12-basic/13.png)

Almost similar to basic 5, you need to play around with the URL bar. However, you need to play around with the PHP error. To revoke the error, simply enter the following URL.

<span id="7"></span>

## basic 7

![basic 7 quest](/assets/images/challengeland/2020-08-12-basic/15.png)

Well, this is the classic CTF technique. You need to change the user agent to the one suggested by the question. For chrome, simply go to the network conditions and customized your user-agent.

<span id="8"></span>

## basic 8

![basic 8 quest](/assets/images/challengeland/2020-08-12-basic/17.png)

Just a cookie with sunglasses? That is an obvious hint, the cookie. Play around with the cookie, change the isAdmin parameter into 1.

<span id="9"></span>

## basic 9

![basic 9 quest](/assets/images/challengeland/2020-08-12-basic/19.png)

I hate and also love this challenge. It took me 2 hours to solve it and I realized it was talking about robots.txt. Megatron is a robot and father (I prefer mother) refers to the root of the website.

![basic 9 ans](/assets/images/challengeland/2020-08-12-basic/20.png)

Enter the URL and solve the challenge.

## Conclusion

That's all for the Challenge Land basic category and we just slay all the bees. I hope you enjoy the write-up and see you next time :)
