Hello there, welcome to another CTFlearn write-up. Today we are going for something a bit weird where all these challenges are categorized as Misc. The challenge can be OSINT, some point grabbing and etc. Even though most of the challenge getting the low rating but I'm still loving it.

## 1) Where Can My Robot Go?

[Link: https://ctflearn.com/challenge/107](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/107)

The flag is located inside the robots.txt of the website.

```
https://ctflearn.com/robots.txt
```

## 2) Practice Flag

[Link: https://ctflearn.com/challenge/125](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/125)

Just copy and submit the flag.

## 3) Reversal of fortune

Reverse the text and capture the flag.

## 4) Wikipedia

[Link: https://ctflearn.com/challenge/168](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/168)

You need to search the people with IP  128.125.52.138 who edited the article. The URL to the archive is.

```
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=676540540
```

What an innovative OSINT.

## 5) QR Code

[Link: https://ctflearn.com/challenge/228](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/228)

Download the QR code. After that, decode the QR with an [online decoder](https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx).

![qr scan](/assets/images/ctflearn/2020-08-15-misc-easy/6.png)

The text is encoded with base64. Decode it.

Okay, another cipher. [Rot 13](https://rot13.com/) this time.

## 6) QR Code v2

[Link: https://ctflearn.com/challenge/236](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/236)

Similar to the previous task, download the QR code and decode it.

You are given a URL. Download the flag file from the URL.

## 7) IP Tracer  

[Link: https://ctflearn.com/challenge/686]

This is another OSINT. With the given IP, use the [iplocation](https://www.iplocation.net/) to locate the IP country.

The answer is London by the way.

## Conclusion

That's it, a complete easy write-up for a weird CTFlearn challenge. Well, more coming soon. Bye ;)
