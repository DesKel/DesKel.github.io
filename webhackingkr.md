Webhacking.kr is another CTF style that mainly focuses on web hacking which included XSS, SQLi, PHP misconfiguration, session hijacking, etc. For your information, the site was created by the Korean. Even though the web UI is quite sloppy by the time the write-up is created but the content is rich enough to blow your mind.

Note: Currently there are 61 old challenges. Expecting new challenges coming through this year, 2020.
